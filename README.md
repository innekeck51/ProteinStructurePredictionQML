# ProteinStructurePredictionQML
Protein folding is very usefull for catalyst design, enzimatic, and molecular biology. In this github, i will share to you about my introduction research about folding protein prediction use quantum computing. Before i do this research, i ever use quantum computer (IBMQ Experience) for image compression in my thesis research.
